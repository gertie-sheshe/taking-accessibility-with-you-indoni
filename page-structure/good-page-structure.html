             <h1>Taking Accessibility With You</h1>
             <h2>Understanding your user.</h2>
             <p>
                I will highlight how important it is to understand the different types of users
                before kicking off a project. This talk will show that users use the web differently
                in different scenarios, that there are users who are temporarily disabled and those that
                are fully disabled and so they access content using assistive technologies.
             </p>
             <h2>Design</h2>
             <p>
                This section will focus on the importance of simplicity in design and layout of your website
                for easier consumption of content. It will also stress on the importance of color contrast, accessible forms,
                how to better do data visualisation and what font sizes make your website easier to access.
             </p>
             <h2>Development</h2>
             <p>
                In this section, I will take the audience through how to develop the site in an accessible manner.
                I will talk about how to use semantic mark up, how to make accessible custom elements, how to use
                ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and best practices to follow for links, 
                images and tabbing order. This part will have code samples and demos.
             </p>
             <h2>Testing</h2>
             <p>
                Itâ€™s always important to measure how accessible your site is. In this section I will take the audience
                through different ways and tools to use to test out their sites. I will talk about Keyboard Navigation,
                Google Lighthouse, Color Contrast checker, Screen Readers (Voice Over on Mac, Talk Back on Android, JAWS on Windows), 
                WAVE, WebAIM and other tools that improve testing and ensure your site is well accessible.
